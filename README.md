### Scenario

A community with many (unnecessary) rules had a problem with a lot of users never reading the terms of service and getting banned for breaking them.

### Solution

An add-on that keeps track of how much time a user spent reading the terms before joining the site and enforcing a minimum reading time, if the admin wishes.
